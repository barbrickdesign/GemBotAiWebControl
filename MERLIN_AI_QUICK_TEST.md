## ✅ WHAT TO CHECK

### Visual Checks:
- [ ] Status badge turns GREEN ✅
- [ ] All 6 test buttons are enabled
- [ ] Results appear in the bottom panel
- [ ] Model badge shows "gemini-1.5-flash"
- [ ] Timestamp updates with each test
- [ ] Token count displayed (if available)

### Console Checks:
Open browser console (F12) and verify:
- [ ] "🧙‍♂️ Merlin AI module loaded"
- [ ] "🧙‍♂️ Initializing Merlin AI..."
- [ ] "✅ Merlin AI initialized successfully"
- [ ] "🧙‍♂️ Merlin says: [introduction text]"
- [ ] No red error messages

### Response Quality Checks:
- [ ] Responses are relevant (not generic)
- [ ] Suggestions are specific and actionable
- [ ] Numbers make sense (scores 1-10, hours realistic)
- [ ] Markdown formatting is clean
- [ ] Security/performance items are code-specific

---

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Problem: Status stays "Initializing..."

**Solution 1:** Check internet connection
```bash
# Gemini API requires internet
ping google.com
```

**Solution 2:** Check API key
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
console.log(window.merlinAI.apiKey);
// Should show: AIzaSyCKuf5EVZ-ldHErhG3OkIw9Zz6jb_w3nMc
```

**Solution 3:** Check browser console for errors
```bash
F12 → Console tab → Look for red errors
```

### Problem: Test returns error message

**Check:**
1. API key is valid (not expired)
2. Gemini API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. No CORS errors in console
4. Internet connection is stable

**Try:**
```javascript
// Manual test in console:
window.merlinAI.generate('Hello').then(r => console.log(r));
```

### Problem: Response is generic or off-topic

**This is OK!** Sometimes AI responses vary. Try:
1. Run the test again (AI is non-deterministic)
2. Different runs may give different insights
3. As long as structure is correct, it's working

### Problem: Taking too long (>10 seconds)

**Normal:** 2-6 seconds per request  
**Slow:** 7-10 seconds (acceptable)  
**Too Slow:** >10 seconds  

**Solution:**
- Check network speed
- Try different test (some are faster)
- Gemini API might be under load (retry in 1 minute)

```html
<!-- Add before closing </head> tag -->
<script src="merlin-ai-integration.js"></script>
```

2. **Add Merlin Summary Button:**
```html
<!-- In AI Agents section -->
<button id="merlinSummaryBtn" class="btn" 
        style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);">
  🧙‍♂️ Merlin AI Summary
</button>
```

3. **Wire Up Button:**
```javascript
// Add to event listeners section
document.getElementById('merlinSummaryBtn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const summary = await window.merlinAI.summarizeRepositoryFlow({
    name: currentRepo,
    totalValue: repositoryValue.total,
    totalHours: repositoryValue.hours,
    nodeCount: nodes.length,
    avgComplexity: nodes.reduce((s, n) => s + (n.metrics?.complexity || 0), 0) / nodes.length,
    topNodes: nodes.sort((a, b) => b.value - a.value).slice(0, 10)
  });
  
  // Show in inspector
  document.getElementById('inspectorContent').innerHTML = `
    <h2>🧙‍♂️ Merlin AI Analysis</h2>
    <div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">${summary.text}</div>
  `;
});
```
