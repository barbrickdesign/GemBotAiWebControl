## 🧪 Test 8: Value Calculation Accuracy

### Manual Validation:
1. Select a simple node (e.g., 100 lines, 5 functions)
2. Calculate expected value:
   ```
   codeLines = 100
   functions = 5
   complexity = 20 (estimated)
   
   devHours = (100 / 12) + (5 * 0.5) = 8.33 + 2.5 = 10.83 hrs
   complexityMultiplier = 1 + (log(21) / 10) = 1.305
   devHours *= complexityMultiplier = 14.13 hrs
   
   docRatio = 10 / 100 = 0.1
   docBonus = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1
   devHours *= docBonus = 15.54 hrs
   
   statusMultiplier = 1.2 (if complete)
   baseValue = 15.54 * $75 * 1.2 = $1,398.60
   
   dependencyBonus = 1 + (log(3) / 20) = 1.055
   totalValue = $1,398.60 * 1.055 = ~$1,475
   ```
3. Compare with displayed value
4. Verify within ±10% margin

### Validation Criteria:
- Calculation formula matches implementation
- Values reasonable for industry standards
- $50-150/hour effective rate
- Status multipliers applied correctly

## 🧪 Test 9: Layer Identification Accuracy

### Steps:
1. After agent deployment, console log layer breakdown
2. Verify node distribution makes sense

- **Utility (1-3):** Helper modules, shared components, utilities
- **Integration (4-8):** Core features, main pages, API integrations
- **Core (9+):** Framework files, authentication, database handlers

### Test Each Layer:
1. Click nodes in each layer
2. Verify layer badge matches utility score
3. Check that suggestions are layer-appropriate:
   - Peripheral: "Consider promoting to utilities"
   - Core: "High complexity - refactor recommended"

### Validation Criteria:
- Layer assignment matches connection count
- Peripheral nodes are truly isolated
- Core nodes have highest connectivity
- Layer colors match (gray/purple/orange/red)
